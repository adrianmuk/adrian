             <p>Hi, I am Adrian Mukisa your guide through the teen code program. Teen code through Andela empowers the youth with computer practical skills such as <em>coding</em> and <em>programming</em>. Through these programs, the youth are able to acquire skills that would erase the <strong>fixed mind-set</strong> of <b>job seeking</b>.</p><br> With the ever evolving world, especially IT related we believe that we are not only preparing the youth for the present but also for the future.
