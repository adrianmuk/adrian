                <p>If there were awards for the best work place ever, Andela would take that award each and every other year. The warm welcome at the reception, the cool atmosphere, the awesome learning facilitators that make you feel like you‚Äôve known them for ages: James Katarikawe, Patrick Walukagga and Shakira Ndagire and don‚Äôt get me started on the snacksüç™ and game consoles üéÆ. Learning to code has always been my dream though I thought it was way harder than it actually is. I don‚Äôt know if others have the same perspective but the group mates I have and the learning facilitators make it so fascinatingly easy to learn. Software developing is interesting and I am really lucky to have a chance to master it from the finest place; Andela. The road seems to still be stretching further, so I hope to keep learning more till it is all over.
